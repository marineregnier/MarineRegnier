This site aims to introduce the United Kingdom, which consists of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom, whose full name is the _United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland_, is a country in Europe. The United Kingdom, as we know it today, was finalised in 1922.

## **S O M E &nbsp; D E F I N I T I O N S**

Before exploring this site, it is important to consider the different terminology that is often used awkwardly. The United Kingdom is made up of the four countries mentioned above, while Great Britain refers to the main island where England, Scotland and Wales are located, with Northern Ireland being located on the neighbouring island, ~~it is not part of Great Britain~~. Below you can find a map which illustrates this distinction to be taken into account.
